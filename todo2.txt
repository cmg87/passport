i need to figure out the object/array whatever json im getting back from the schema. 

pass in each fucking thing to the factory just the name and display
that as a file

then while passing in the filename call the child function to just
use those numbers and map that to the children nodes tree

once i get that done setup a state if this particular factory is clicked
display those children

also setup a button to generate new factories and a button next to them 
to edit the factory and a button to reset everything

once thats done i gotta figure out how to use SSE or websockets

AAANNNDD DONE!
